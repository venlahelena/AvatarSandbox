# Avatar Sandbox

## Overview
**Avatar Sandbox** is a personal interactive web application built with **CodeIgniter 4** (PHP only).  
The app allows users to create accounts, customize avatars, adopt pets, visit different locations, and interact with AI-driven avatars.  
This project serves as a sandbox to learn and explore PHP, backend logic, and frontend interactivity using CodeIgniter's MVC structure. All features are implemented using PHP views, controllers, and models—no external frontend frameworks required.
